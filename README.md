# In-between-Binary <br>

*In-between Binary is an experimental essay written by Jazmin Morris in the format of a README.* <br>

HIS-torically, black and/or queer folk and other marginalised
identities have been undocumented and erased by colonial lenses.
Now, the binary structures that are facilitating our existence
continue to sensor, surveil and delete. <br>

We are presented with interfaces that feed addiction but do not
water expression. <br>

We are encouraged to USE(r) and discouraged to question. <br>

We are trapped in languages that we can not speak, and when we
learn to speak them, they advance.

We are forced to exist between the binary therefore, we must learn <br>
to thrive here. <br>
>*“The binary body confuses and disorients, pitting our
interests against one another across modalities of otherness.”*
(Legacy Russell, 2020) <br>

I am not sure if we can decolonise a WWWeb that was built on our
suffering and capitalises on our pain. The very fibres of our
so-called hardware are stolen. They call it MODERN slavery but
what makes slavery modern? <br>
>*“When we look at the history of digital devices, it is quite
clear that the burden of digital media’s device production is borne
disproportionately by the women of color who make them.”*
(Lisa Nakamura, 2014) <br>

<pre> The system is bro <br> 
                      ken and so I ask, what does soft-ware feel like? </pre>
What if binary was bent? <br>
What if the Web was a home and not a sticky trap? <br>

I recently did a workshop with a community of femxle herbalists.
One womxn touched me when she quoted the Ancient Egyptians and
said:
>*“A society that advances technically without advancing
spiritually is destined for failure.”* (Her name is Riaz)

Riaz is an elder, a posser of healing, herbalist knowledge. Where
is the space for her spirit in their code?<br>

We are forced to exist between the binary therefore, we must learn
to thrive here.<br>

On Thriving:<br>
## Redistribution
We must work to redistribute knowledge, power and resources.
Foster a world in which skills are shared, not bought. **Translate** &
create code & information in the native languages spoken by black
and brown people. Use open-source as a methodology for community
building. Encourage annotation:<br>

<! -- annotation promotes education and liability -->
## Speculation
We must empower people to speculate, imagine and play.
Support Afrofuturism. Construct pockets of utopia. Nurture
glitches and the art of tinkering.
## Degrowth
We must p a u s e.
Reuse, repurpose and recycle what we have. Use existing data to
positively respond to peoples behaviour. Stop to think, question
and critique.<br>
